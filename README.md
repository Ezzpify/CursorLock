# FAQ

## Q: *How often does the program check which window is active?*

Every 2 seconds.

## Q: *Can this cause a VAC ban or any other anti-cheat bans?*

Short answer: No. Long answer: Anti-cheats look for software that modifies the game data or access the game data in a way that is not intended. This software does not interact with any games or windows at all. It just queries a function which returns which window is currently active, then checks if the active window name matches any window names that you have typed in. So no, you can't get VAC banned or banned by any other anti-cheat.
